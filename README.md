# üöÄ Building My Own Large Language Model (LLM) from Scratch

Welcome to my project where I built a Large Language Model (LLM) entirely from scratch without relying on any external frameworks or APIs! This project dives deep into the fundamentals of transformer-based architectures and showcases how modern generative models like GPT are structured and trained.

## üìö Key Features and Components

### 1. **Custom Tokenization and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**
- Developed a custom tokenizer with Byte Pair Encoding for effective subword tokenization.
- Handles out-of-vocabulary words gracefully by breaking them into known subword units.

### 2. **Attention Mechanisms**
- Implemented self-attention, causal self-attention, and multi-head attention mechanisms.
- Includes attention masking for proper sequence handling.

### 3. **Embedding Layers**
- Designed token embeddings and sinusoidal positional embeddings.
- Supports rich contextual representation learning.

### 4. **Transformer Architecture**
- Built modular transformer blocks featuring:
  - Layer Normalization
  - Residual Connections
  - GELU Activation Function

### 5. **Training Strategies**
- Pretraining from scratch with a 124M parameter GPT-2 model architecture.
- Implemented fine-tuning methods for domain-specific tasks.

### 6. **Optimization Techniques**
- Custom loss function design and optimization routines.
- Applied gradient clipping and weight initialization for stable training.

### 7. **Sampling Methods**
- Integrated various text generation strategies:
  - Temperature Scaling
  - Top-k Sampling
  - Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling

### 8. **Data Pipeline**
- Efficient data loading with input-target pair generation.
- Supports large-scale datasets for training.

### 9. **Model Checkpointing**
- Save and load custom model weights.
- Enables experiment tracking and model recovery.

### 10. **Evaluation Metrics**
- Implemented metrics to assess LLM performance on real-world datasets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy, PyTorch (optional for GPU acceleration), and Matplotlib for visualizations

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLM-from-Scratch.git
cd LLM-from-Scratch

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training the Model
```bash
# Run the training script
python train.py --config configs/train_config.json
```

### Generating Text
```bash
# Generate text with the trained model
python generate.py --prompt "Once upon a time"
```

## üìà Results
- Successfully trained a 124M parameter GPT-2-like model from scratch.
- Demonstrated coherent text generation with various sampling methods.
